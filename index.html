  		<h1>Why Isn’t New York Prioritizing Women of Color in the Cannabis Industry? </h1>

	New York’s Office of Cannabis Management says it is prioritizing disadvantaged groups for licensing to establish an equitable cannabis industry, but the numbers say it is failing. 
		</p>

<p>
	New York legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2021. The Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA) established the <a href="https://cannabis.ny.gov/social-and-economic-equity" target="_blank">Social and Economic Equity (SEE) program</a>  “to incentivize participation in this new industry for individuals disproportionally impacted by cannabis prohibition,” according to New York’s Office of Cannabis Management (OCM). 
</p>

<p>But the OCM has distributed more than half its active licenses to non-women-owned and non-minority-owned businesses. Licensed cannabis businesses owned by women minorities account for only seven percent of all active licenses, according to OCM data.  
</p>

<p> Out of over 2,000 total active licenses in New York, non-minority women-owned businesses account for 329, compared with 242 non-women minority-owned businesses, according to data from OCM. This could suggest that licensure favors whiteness over maleness; that racial bias has more impact than gender bias in business ownership.
</p>

</p>

<p>“I honestly don’t think that the SEE categories actually gave you any extra boost in terms of the application and licensing,” said Vanessa Yee-Chan, owner of <a href="https://altadispensary.nyc/" target="_blank">Alta Dispensary</a>  in Lower Manhattan.
</p>

<p>Both women and minorities face unique challenges in owning and operating a business. People of color are twice as likely to be denied a business loan than their white counterparts, according to a 2021 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Almost half of all American women entrepreneurs experienced gender bias when trying to raise capital, according to a 2019 Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company (HSBC) survey. 
</p>

<p>At the intersection of these disadvantages, women of color face compounding obstacles to business success. 
</p>

<p>Yee-Chan was part of an early wave of cannabis businesses to obtain an OCM license in 2024. She said she attributes her licensure to her own good luck as well as years of research. The business owner said her SEE status as a woman and a minority earned her a discount on the OCM application fee, but not much else.
</p>

<p>“They tout it as that you get priority, but in actuality it never came to fruition,” said Yee-Chan. 
</p>

<p>After she submitted her application, it entered a lottery along with all of the other applications — including those from businesses lacking SEE status, said the business owner. Alta Dispensary got an early license because Yee-Chan got a good lottery number, she said. Even with a license, Yee-Chan said owning a cannabis dispensary in New York is an uphill battle.
</p>

<p>
	However, cannabis businesses that are both women-owned and minority-owned are the most scarcely represented in the OCM licensure data. It seems that offering a discount for SEE applicants will not be enough to achieve the social and economic equity New York sought with legalization.
